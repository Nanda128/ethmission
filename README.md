# EthMission - A Web3 Ticketing DApp

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nanda128/ethmission.git
    cd ethmission
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
      npm install
    ```
   
3. Start the development server by running Live Server and opening up index.html
    * If you are using WebStorm, you can right-click on index.html and select ``Open in > Browser > [Your browser of choice]``.
    * This application has not been tested to work on WebStorm/Jetbrains IDE's inbuilt browser, please use a native browser.

## Setup Recommendations:

To be able to test out the full scope of the application, I recommend you make the following wallets:

1. A "Doorman" wallet. This doesn't need to contain any SETH.
2. A "User_1" wallet. This should contain at least 0.01 SETH.
3. A "User_2" wallet. This should also contain at least 0.01 SETH.
4. (Optionally) A "Venue Manager"/"Event Creator" wallet, which you use to create events.

This differentiation between wallets helps test the application realistically,
since multiple users with multiple addresses would usually be using this application.

Metamask is the recommended wallet program to use for creating and managing these wallets,
since you'd find yourself switching between them often.

If you encounter issues with the application connecting with a wallet you accidentally entered,
refresh the page, switch to your wallet of choice in Metamask, and click on the "Connect account" popup.
